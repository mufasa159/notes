Ideology

body of ideas that relflect social need aspirration needs of individuals, groups, class, or culture
given set of values are typiclly implocit
every film has a perspective that privillleges certain characters, values, and ideas
fluctuates based on film

really about power
    who has it
    who benefits from it
    who suffers from that power dynamic

an internalized image of ones place within all of the social dynamics related to 
power and hierarchy... 

how do we assess or analyze ideology in film? 
    need theories
    has theories / theoretical model

most relies on film design

subtle terms b which cinema codes things into view
how filmmakers view reality
it can give control over them, sometimes it takes control

when analyzinf film from ideological perspective, we're looking at more than one theory
    film techniques
    storytelling
    feminist theory
    race theory
    representations
    etc.

Terminologies
    dominant ideology - thing that uphold existing relation and hierarchy
        operates to normalize and naturalize the status quo
        to be successful, it must be invisible, censor, or suppress ideas that challenge it
    alternative ideology - thing that challenges or diverts dominant ideology

things to avoid
    getting trapped in intended meaning
    assigned authorship
        thousands of individuals who had their hands in the process it's a lot muddier
        they are all authors but usually for simplifying it's the director which is misleading
        as a critic we never really know the true author
    
cinemas are to teach and provide pleasure

broad categories in film
    neutral
        have no position whatsoever and claim to be unbiased
        almost impossible to find
    implicit
        protagonist and antagonist representing conflicting values of system. 
        over majority of fiction/narrative films fall into this category
    explicit
        they are really aimed to persuade you rather than entertain you
        such as documentary, propaganda, or educational films

"food ink" (watch it) falls into explicit
"algore's an inconvenient truth" fall into explicit category

we can start with director, the star system (the cast members)
the stars will carry external baggage with them into the film

other methods to enlistt sympathies or not
    underdogs
    emotionally vulnerable charactersfunny, charming, intelligent characters
    negatively drawn characters 

typically in the industry:
    physically larger person > source of comedy
    lgbtq > emotinoally vulnerable 
    black people, disabled etc. gets infused with negative stereotypes

language of film:
    cinematography
    ideologies

Left-center-right model
    do not try to label a film as fascist, socialist, leftist, etc. unless it's propaganda
    where it might fall in the spectrum
    context is important

political ideologies that are underneath that will give ideas

bipolar categories for analyzing films:
helps you determine where the film falls in the spectrum
    democratic vs hierarchical system
    environment vs heredity
    relative vs absolute
    secular vs religious
    future vs past
    cooperative vs competitions
    outsiders vs insiders
    international vs nationalist

culture, religion, ethnicity : usually helps with where film falls in left, center, right
    traditions, institutions, arts, myths and beliefs
    cultutral generations
    risk of stereotypes
        gender
        race
        sexuality
    must consider tone
        reflect, reinforce, challenge
    
A thought question:
    you are living in the code(?) era and you're filmmakers, and a queer
    you were told explicitly you cannot put queer material in the film
    how do you do it?
    trying to find ways to represent people like you so that people who are like you
    will see themselves in the film
    artists wanting to get that visibility happen with subtle ways like
        marlyn monroe wearing a suit
        little mermaid tribute to drag queens
    embedding a sense of self in the film

there will be more details in film noir chapter
watch spotlight for this week

any film you watch, ask where might it go and why you'd put it there
to make this work, you have to do it considerably. take tone into account.
    how does the film present? how does it reinforce? how does it challenge?
    we can look at things like genres, acting styles, music orchestration etc.

some example ideologies in film:
    capitalism
    monogamy
    patriarchy
    heteronormativity

Progressing films (usually left of center)
often engage with following thematics:
    queer trans acceptance
    challenge racism
    working class soliderity
    women in power
    social justice themes
    personal and societal responsibilities
    challenge of corporate abuse
    abuse of power
going against the grain of dominant ideology
