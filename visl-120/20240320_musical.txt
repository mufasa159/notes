Very specific moment in history:

dominated by 5 major film producers:
    MGM
    Paramount
    FOX
    Warner Brothers
    RKO
[ will not test onthis list ]

these 5 studios has total dominance and monopoly over the film industry
from preproduction to root distribution - vertical integration

policy of block booking:
    if you want to show one of our films, you have to show all of our films
    this is a way to force theaters to show their films

    way to guarantee profit

    small studios were not able to compete with this

Star Power
    actors were under contract with the studios
    studios would loan out actors to other studios

emerging of new technology like sound

ended because of things like television
since they started popping up more in households

rise in production convertsretirement or death of the major hollywood stars.
audience loss as a result

1948: The Paramount Decision: Supreme Court case that ruled that the major studios had to divest themselves of their theaters
allowed other studios in that they were locked out of

politicians were trying to break up the monopoly

with more streaming services
    netflix
    amazon
    disney+
    etc

reproccussion of this decision is still being felt today
disney only shows disney film
netflix only netflix

3 or more songs were considered musicals

sub-genres
    show muscial
        has things to do with show business
    folk musical
    fairytale musical

the movie we were supposed to watch:
    fits into folk musical sub-genre
    family, location, real places

labels musical as hybrid genre
