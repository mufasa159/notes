 n
motivaiton for the gangster
    long to main society

drives the gangster genre
    search for american dream
    othe darker side of the myth of american dream
    the dark side of materialism

films are based in history but not necessarily true

exaggerate things for better narrative
timing of probation

motivations of the gangsters are accurate but not the resemblance of their actual life
you couldn't have a gangster as the hero

parabole
    the american identity, nationalism
    fergility of american identity
    immigration in america

gangster has an maerican tragedy

core iconography
    character appearance 
        not lower class clothing but also not high class
        form of outsiderness
    settings
        usually in urban settings, intercity in lower-class areas
        immigrant communities
        pretty historically accurate on that front for a while
    cop car
    the moll
        being the oppsite of being motherly
        quite often a blode - racial difference and american dream
        the ganster version of a wife
        not very maternal, very verbal, vocal, make their opinions known
        materialism

    sopranos -> shift
        own dramatic problem, cease to be a possession of the gangster
        Kay(?) - normal woman who thought she was dating a typical middle-class man but turned out ot be false and
        accepts. she has to deal with the consequences
        "proper middle class girl" who has to deal with the consequences of their choice

        "karen hill" from goodfellas
            first woman voice-over in the film
            usually the point of view is from men, but with goodfellas we get her point of view from her voice-over
            she's jewish

        goodfellas is based on true story, highly fictionalized
        tension between segragated identities, italian, jewish etc.

    fundamental shifts: 
        increase in violence, after godfather there wasa lot of showing of blood and gore
        settings: from inner-city to undergrounds and outer boroughs of the city, some out of country, vegas, cuba, small towns
        shifting out of middle class areas etc.
        thematically: more motivated on family than materialism
        core thematics: what's the driving force? 
        family and respect: core thematics post goodfellas
        the gangster genres goes lean on that family and respect
