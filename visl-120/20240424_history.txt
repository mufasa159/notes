Four approaches to film history
    aesthetic
        film as art
        what was the first film? a debate because it depends on what you consider a film
    technological
        specific type of camera, lighting, sound etc.
    economic
        placed withing the economic history of the studio
        country
        industry
        knowing that a $5M budget in 1960s is different than a $5M budget in 2024
    film as social history
        society and culture influence films and vice versa
        how films reflect the society in which they were made
        how they influence society
        how they are influenced by society

representations of indigenous people in the searchers:
    it was easier for us to see the racism in the film in 2024
    but it was not a film that was seen as racist in 1956

things that in the moment today we might thing as progressive and forward thinking but in 10-50 years 
audience might see them as poor choices.

representation of queerness in 1970s vs in 2024: very different

our assessment of a film continues to change over time

why are the villains "hella gay" in earlier disney animated films? 
looking at the history, capitalism, hays-code, it makes sense but without those contexts it ight seems like 
queerness/gayness is bad.

"the celluloid closet" (?) documentary film. about history of LGBTQ representation

"airport" from 1970s
"airplane" movie
    things that we laugh about will make more sense when we see other films from the same genre
    it's a pre-911 film but not a pre-terrorism film.

"bound" early boukwaski(?) film, early neo-noir


four main cycles of film genres
    primitive
    classical
        emboding the core ideas of the genre
    revisionist
        noe-noir is difinitely revisionist
    parodic

the starting point to go beyond that. it's not the end
we often come to class looking for definitive answers but we are not going to get them

fatal woman, the 
what women were feeling post wwii
women went into the factories to help
they had indisposable income, in their name, beginning of freedom
when soldiers came back from the war they didn't know what to do and wanted to take their freedom away


we have to pause, we are inside a world where we feel an emotion and immediately react to it

people's pursuit of order when the nature is always chaotic
we don't like absense of order
anything after 1959 is neo-noir, because of the introduction to color (all film-historians agree on this)

LA Confidential is fantastic, the color, the neo-noir

execution (capital punishment) and suicide etc. was not permitted in films
questioning the legitimiacy of the ecosystems

"double indemnity" film:
    if we feel even a ittle bit of empathy for the character, sudden;y we might as an audience might think
    gas chamber was too extreme. Censors don't want that. 

    the rules are unraveling but there's still there.

    many directors try to find loopholes to show/convey the idea of the censored shots
