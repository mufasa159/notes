Sound

The Jazz Singer - 1927
The Talkie era


Problems with early sound recording
    incredibly dull
    camera was restricted
    actors couldn't move
    required synchronization
    editing was minimal

lost a lot of depth
limited with tech, editors couldn't remove a lot of extraneous noise

actors struggled with expressive gesturing
many left the industry because couldn;t adapt

Formalist vs Realists

Eisentstein

forces acting style to be more naturilistic

sound recording
    microphone: converts sounds waves to recorded signals
    more digital format with flexibility for editing
    dialogue
    souble system recording the idea that sound is recorded in a separate medium and then
    merge the two in editing

Soudn editing
    sound editor: 
        overal process of the sound editing
        works with musical composers
    crew:
        generating and controlling the sound
    post production:
        sounds effects and music added after the film is shot
    automatic dialogue system:
        sophisticated computerized system that allows the editor to replace dialogue with a cleaner version
    sound mixing:
    sound track: 
        individual track of sound

Describing film sounds
    pitch or level: 
        high like tire screeching, lower like thunder, frequency or speed of sound waves
    loudness: 
        volume and intensity, depends on amplitude
    quality
        texture or color
        elements of quality: trumpet vs trumbone, not all brass instruments sound the same
    fidelity
        faithfulness or accuracy of the sound
        high fidelity: sound is accurate
        low fidelity: sound is distorted
        example: 
            not seeing what is being heard

Diegetic sound
    sound that comes from the world of the film
    can be internal or external but originates from the world of the film
    the characters in the film are aware of the sound

Nondiegetic sound 
    sound that comes from outside the world of the film
    the characters in the film are not aware of the sound
    music is the most common form of non-diagetic sound but not all music is non-diagetic

Onscreen sound
    sound that comes from a source that we see on screen
    example: 
        a character playing a guitar
        a car horn honking
        a dog barking
    simultenous sound

offscreen sound
    comes from a source we can't see
    could be diegetic or nondiegetic

internal vs external
    internal: 
        sound that comes from inside the mind of a character
        example: 
            voice over
            internal monologue
            internal dialogue
    external:
        sound that comes from outside the mind of a character
        example: 
            dialogue
            sound effects
            music
    can get muddy sometimes, like heart beat; could be internal or external

    environmental: sound effects
    music

    unusual places

music
