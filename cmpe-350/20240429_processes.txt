Processes

Process: program in execution 
    - aka. jobs, tasks

System: collection of processes
    - OS processes executing system code
    - User processes executing user code
    - CPU multiplexed among the processes

Example of processes:
    General Purpose Processes (GPP)
        - Web browsers
        - Text editors
        - Email clients
    Embedded Processes
        - No multitasking
        - Runs at least the OS

Components of a Process
    - Program code = text section
    - Program counter = PC
    - CPU registers
    - Stack
    - Data section
    - Heap

A program becomes a process when it is loaded into memory
    - ex: double clicking on icon
    - ex: typing command in shell

Special type of process: Virtual Machine
    - Example: JAVA
    - it can emulate a different OS, different hardware, different ISA


Process States
    - NEW        : process is being created
    - READY      : process is waiting to be assigned to a processor
    - RUNNING    : instructions are being executed
    - WAITING    : process is waiting for some event to occur
    - TERMINATED : process has finished execution

                       ,----------- interrupt ----------, ,----> exit --> TERMINATED
                       |                                | |
                       ↓                                | |
NEW --> admitted --> READY --> scheduler dispatch --> RUNNING --> I/O event waiting --> WAITING
                       ↑                                                                  |
                       |                                                                  |
                       '------------------ I/O or event completion -----------------------'


Process Control Block (PCB) ***** VERY IMPORTANT
    - represents each process in the OS (or task control block)
    - contains all the information needed to run the process
    - contains:
        - process state: NEW, READY, RUNNING, WAITING, TERMINATED
        - program counter: address of next instruction
        - CPU registers
        - CPU scheduling information: process priority, pointers to queues etc.
        - memory management information: memory limits, page tables, segment tables etc.
        - accounting information: CPU used, clock time elapsed, account numbers, process numbers etc.
        - I/O status information: list of I/O devices allocated to the process, list of open files etc.


CPU uses multiple processes
GPU uses single process
