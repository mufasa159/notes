Pipeline

Stages:
    Instruction fetch
    Instruction decode
    Execute
    Memory access
    Write back


Structural Hazard:
    Two instructions need the same resource at the same time
    When you don't have enough hardware resources to execute instructions simultaneously
    Example: Two instructions need to access memory at the same time

Data Hazard:
    When an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction in the pipeline
    Example: Instruction 2 depends on the result of instruction 1

    Solution:
        Forwarding / Bypassing: 
            Pass the result of an instruction directly to the next instruction
        Stalling: 
            Wait until the result of the previous instruction is available

Control Hazard:
    When the pipeline makes a wrong decision on a branch instruction
    Example: The pipeline fetches the wrong instruction after a branch

    Solution:
        Branch prediction: 
            Predict whether a branch will be taken or not
        Speculative execution: 
            Execute instructions speculatively based on the prediction
