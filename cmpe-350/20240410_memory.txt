Memory Hierarchy

--------- Faster Access Time, Higher Level

Registers                        // Part of on-chip CPU datapath
Cache (L1, L2, L3, ...)          // One more level, static RAM
Main Memory                      // Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
Magnetic Disk                    // Virtual Memory
Optical Disk or Magnetic Tape    // HDD, SSD

--------- Slower Access Time, Lower Level

Terms

Temporal Locality
    If an item is referenced, it will tend to be referenced again soon. 
Spatial Locality
    If an item is referenced, items whose addresses are close by will tend to be referenced soon.

Cache hit
    data is found in the cache
Cache miss
    data is not found in the cache and must be fetched from the main memory

Directly mapped cache
    each block of main memory maps to exactly one block in the cache
Set associative cache
    each block of main memory maps to a set of blocks in the cache
Fully associative cache
    each block of main memory maps to any block in the cache
